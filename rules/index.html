        <li>0. This game is a way for all of us to recollect one of the most extraordinary years of our life</li>
        <li>1. This game can become dangerously addictive.</li>
        <li>2. The gameplay involves getting to the next level by any means necessary.</li>
        <li>3. This may involve entering the answer in the text box, changing the URL in the address bar or clicking on
            various objects on the page.</li>
        <li>4. At most times, you may have to blackmail/threaten/beg other people for the answer to next level. We do
            not have anything against that.</li>
        <li>5. There are NO special characters or spaces in the answers, and they are not case sensitive.</li>
        <li>6. Be sure of yourself before entering any answer.</li>
        <li>7. Usually, the clues for each level can be found in:<br>
            - Page Title<br>
            - URL<br>
            - Pictures on the level<br>
            - Page source: Use Ctrl + U or Right-click -> View Page Source<br>
            - Console log: Use Ctrl + Shift + I or Right-click -> Inspect</li>
        <li>8. Some amount of binary (.txt, .jpg etc.) download/manipulation may be required to get the hint to next
            level.</li>
        <li>9. As we are evil, we may like to distract, deviate or confuse you once in a while.</li>
        <li>10. No answer is obvious, so you have to think out of the box.</li>
        <li>11. Multiple logins are not allowed and avoid incognito mode.</li>
        <li>12. Using Google Chrome may give you a better experience.</li>
